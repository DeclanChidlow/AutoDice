Dice bot for Stoat
</div>
<br/>

Dice bot perfect for role-playing, and especially tabletap RPGs (TTRPGs) such as Dungeons & Dragons (D&D).

## Documentation and Support

AutoDice's commands and features are documented in the help command, triggered by `@AutoDice help`, and on [the AutoMod website](https://automod.vale.rocks/docs/autodice). If you still have questions or need help, you can join the [support server on Stoat](https://stt.gg/automod). The Stoat server is also a good way to stay in the loop on updates, changes, and development.

## Invite to Your Server

If you're on the official Stoat instance at [stoat.chat](https://stoat.chat) then you can [add AutoDice to your server](https://stoat.chat/bot/01KHB7M1ETS332GBQVXPYH58K2). If you're on a third-party instance, then [you'll need to host it yourself](https://automod.vale.rocks/docs/autodice/self-hosting).
